B  Okay. So what are we having for dinner tonight?
C  I think I'm gonna have pasta, but I'm not sure yet. Like, my my girlfriend said, like, he's going to prepare pasta, so probably past time.
B  Nice.
A  My God, I don't know what I should have. I guess I haven't really thought about it, but I had rice and chicken for lunch. So something that is not right and shaken for dinner.
C  How about you feeling?
B  Yeah, I did Bart chicken and rice last night, so it's probably going to be either spaghetti or had a tiny for me.
B  I do Cook usually. I don't love it, but I don't actively dislike it, which is my wife.
C  That's pretty cool. Yeah. I order most of the time outside. Don't ask. Most of the time. Well, have you even Micho? Right.
A  I do do that a lot, but I've been trying to Cook more often, so I have been doing that all my cooking, like simple meals, like rice and chicken.
B  Do you have a go to take out place?
C  Me. Let's see. There are a bunch of places around here. Like, the one I like the most is called Deli Board. It's like a sandwich place. I've been telling Michael that every time he comes to take him there, but it's never been there. The Deli Board one. Remember Michael? Yeah, that's the best. And it's in SF. It's pretty cool.
A  I still need to try that for me. Take out. I really like, I guess. I don't know. Sushi or Indian food. The Pakistani restaurant? Yeah. Pretty similar. There's Pakistani restaurant. That's Super good. And there's a Sushi restaurant nearby, too. That's really good. So that's what I'd like to take out. It's kind of expensive, though.
B  Yeah, definitely. We moved away. We're close to to our SSI place, and now it's, like, 15 minutes away. Is it worth it? I guess so. Yeah.
C  Do you live in like, you live in Denver, right?
B  Yeah.
C  Like, do you live around downtown or, like, pretty far we did last year.
B  Last year, we were in walking distance at the baseball Stadium Super downtown. But we moved, like, 15, 20 minutes East. Now we have a second bedroom. It's fine for us who didn't be right there.
C  Yeah. Makes sense. That's pretty cool.
